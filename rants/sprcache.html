Sprite caching by Cadaver
-------------------------

0. Introduction

In the <a href="mw4trick.htm">MW4 tricks & techniques rant</a> I've talked about realtime depacked sprites
for fitting more sprite animations in the C64's memory. In the current packed
sprite system I use, a sprite is split into 3x3 slices, each one byte wide and
7 bytes high, and then only the slices which actually contain data are stored,
in addition to a bitmask which tells which slices are occupied. When a sprite
frame needs to be shown, it is depacked into the video bank. To avoid glitches,
a double buffer needs to be allocated for each sprite, so if the multiplexer 
can show eg. 24 sprites maximum, 48 sprites need to be reserved from the video 
memory.

(Note that MW4 used a cut-down version of the depacking for small sprites only,
reducing the slices to 3x2, and skipping double buffering on the assumption that
sprite depacking finishes before the sprites are actually displayed.)

Implemented naively, this leads into a CPU use hit every time some sprite
changes its animation frame, which may easily lead to the game slowing down.
Furthermore, if several sprites (for example explosions) animate in unison,
there is wasted work being done unpacking the same sprite frame for each of
them. While developing Hessian I wanted to reduce the CPU hit (to allow for
all sprites to be packed while maintaining 50Hz), which led into a caching
approach.


1. Caching mechanism

Instead of treating each sprite to be shown individually, we want to ask the 
question "is this sprite frame available yet, or does it need to be depacked?"
Also, we may want to allocate more room than 2 x maximum sprites from the video
bank, to allow repeating animations to remain in the cache.

To be efficient, this requires a two-way mapping. Each packed sprite animation
frame needs to store the knowledge of the cache frame it exists in (or that
it doesn't exist yet), and for erasing the old cache mappings, the unpacked
sprites in the cache need to store which packed frame they refer to.

For each cached sprite an "age" needs to be maintained, for discarding the
oldest cached sprites, and to make sure we never overwrite a sprite that is
currently being shown.


2. Implementation in Hessian

Hessian uses a system where sprites are referred to by a sprite file number,
and a frame number inside the file. It also realtime-flips sprite data to save
roughly half of the memory, but that will not be discussed here. The sprite
cache is 64 frames large, and sits underneath the I/O memory, $d000-$dfff, so 
that the sprite depacking routines are the only ones which need to touch the $01
register. Raster interrupts naturally need to switch I/O memory back on during 
their execution.

The packed sprite data includes a header which contains the slice bitmask,
hotspot information, and color. One more byte was added to the header to
represent the cache frame, or $00 to denote "not cached yet." When sprite
flipping was implemented, it actually became two bytes, cache frame for facing
left, and cache frame for facing right.

When a sprite needs to be displayed, the cache frame byte is read. If nonzero,
nothing further needs to be done, except resetting the cached sprite's age.

If the sprite is not cached yet, we start the search algorithm for determining
a slot in the cache which we can overwrite. This is a simple round-and-round
search which continues from the last cache slot that was written to, and 
furthermore the age system is not terribly intelligent, as it actually counts
only 2 frames: that the sprite is shown on screen right now, or will be shown
after this frame completes. In both cases the cache slot can not be reused, but
if it's older, it can.

When a suitable slot is found, we check the sprite file number and sprite frame
number for the slot, and use those to remove the cache mapping from the old
packed sprite's header (if any.)

Next, the sprite data is actually unpacked, and finally both mappings are
updated: the cache framenumber in the sprite header, and the sprite file, frame
number and age reset for the cached sprite.

To summarize, here's the data structures the caching needs:

Each packed sprite header:

Bitmask + color (2 bytes)
Hotspot and multisprite connection info (6 bytes, both left & right)
Cache framenumber (2 bytes, left & right)

For the cached sprites:

cacheSpriteFile: 64 bytes
cacheSpriteFrame: 64 bytes
cacheSpriteAge: 64 bytes

To see the implementation, see <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/hessian/blob/master/sprite.s" target="_top">sprite.s</a> in the Hessian source code. Note that
the code is optimized and therefore rather learning-unfriendly. The cached
sprite age uses an absolute framenumber system, which is maintained as part of 
the DrawActors routine in another file, <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/hessian/blob/master/actor.s" target="_top">actor.s</a>.
