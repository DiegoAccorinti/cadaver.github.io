<b>6th June 2018:</b><br><br>
MW ULTRA is the new Covert Bitops C64 game in development!<br><br>

It's essentially a reinterpretation or reboot of the first Metal Warrior game, but with substantial changes planned to both the story and gameplay.
The genre is still sidescrolling action-adventure, but the aim is to blend shooting, melee fighting and stealth in a
semi-realistic (or "semi-cinematic") way, with the melee fighting taken further by making the characters capable of multiple moves, including different punches and kicks.<br><br>

Plans for revisiting the first MW game were on the backburner for a long time, including the possibility to use a more powerful platform.
During Steel Ranger's development, ideas how to do it on the C64 materialized instead, along with a very solid rework & expansion of the original's
story. Like in the original, you take the role of Ian, a troubled musician in a not-so-bright near future, but apart from that, expect surprises...<br><br>

Technically, the game borrows the 2x2 tiles from Steel Ranger, but with a larger scrolling window that is redrawn completely from the tilemap data for each
scrolling update, instead of shifting the screen. Tiles can have their color RAM data updated differently to optimize the CPU use of scrolling,
either color-per-char with char & color code the same (completely inspired by Quod Init Exit II), color-per-tile, or skipping
color RAM update where there is a larger patch of the same color.<br><br>

The resource management & code loading / relocation from Steel Ranger likewise makes a comeback. But Steel Ranger contained a shortcoming where loadable or
"story script" code couldn't load further resources from the disk, in the fear that it would get relocated in memory due to old resources getting purged, and
the code execution returning to an illegal address afterward, crashing the game. This time the engine should be capable of handling stack return address relocation to fix this!<br><br>

The music routine is no longer NinjaTracker 2, but the <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/miniplayer" target="_top">"miniplayer"</a> which was released earlier in 2018 as open source.<br><br>

The engine work is going along well, with almost all the "whole time resident" code written, but naturally there is still much work to be done. The game is planned to
be finished in 2019, 20 years after the original's release!<br><br>

Here's the first WIP video, showing player character movement & initial city background graphics. Note: despite being absent in this video, there's certainly going to be all-directional scrolling, and ingame music.<br><br>
